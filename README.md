# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-MLR-Evaluation-Result
Python Data Science Project, Used Car Price Prediction using MLR algo with 98.27% accuracy, RMSE: 1148, MAE: 828, Mallow's_CP: 0.004, D_Watson: 2.17, No Multicollinearity

## About the Car Price Prediction

Price is Target variable & Features are PriceCategory, Company, Aspiratiion, Carbody, Drivewheel, Wheelbase, Carlength, Carwidth, Curbweight, Enginetype, Cylindernumber, Enginesize, Fuelsystem, Boreratio, Horsepower, CityMileage, HighwayMileage.

## Project Overview

In this Project I will try to unleash useful insights using this CAR Price datasets and will perform feature selection to build multiple linear regression model by combining the power of best statistical rules & principles to maximise accuracy at its best. The best thing is my model is not having Multicollinearity problem.

This Project is divided into 13 major steps which are as follows:

1. [Data description](#data-desc)
2. [Importing Libraries & setting up environment](#imp-lib)
3. [Loading dataset](#data-load)
4. [Data Cleaning & Preprocessing](#data-prep)
5. [Exploratory Data Analysis](#data-eda)
6. [OUtlier Detection & Removal](#data-out)
7. [Training & Test Split](#data-train)
8. [Cross Validation](#cross-val)
9. [Model Building](#data-model)
10. [Model evaluation & comparison](#model-eval)<br>
11. [Feature Selection](#model-eval)<br>
12. [Model Evaluation](#model-inter)
13. [Conclusion](#data-conc)
